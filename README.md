# Recurrent-Attention-Model
The Recurrent Attention Model is a deep model that predicts the label of an image that is cluttered with bits from other images (noisy image) and predict the original image using the label. It has drawn inspiration from the Google's Visual Attention Model in 2014. We have expanded the project to use this model on colored images and use the Inception Net model for feature extraction.
